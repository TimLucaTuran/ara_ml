# SASA Stacker
Documentation: https://timlucaturan.github.io/sasa_stacker/

## Installation
This package depends on  googles `tensorflow` which at the time of writing only supports python 3.5 - 3.7 so I recommend creating a virtual environment:

`$ python3.7 -m venv sasa-venv`

and activating it

`$ source sasa-venv/bin/activate`

Now clone the repository

`$ `
